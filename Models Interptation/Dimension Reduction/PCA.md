## PCA
To begin with, lets review the concept of matrix multiplication. Performing a matrix on a vector (matrix multiplication) can be interpreted as a stretched and shrinkaged behaviour. Take a 2-d matrix as an example, the shape of a unit sphere will be pressed and reshaped to another sphere after multipled by a matrix. 

Different matrixs have different effects. Specially, for a symmetric matrix the effects can be drawn and analyzed seperately, which is the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors describe the streched direction of a symmetric matrix and the coresponding eigenvalues are the shrinkaged magnitudes.
