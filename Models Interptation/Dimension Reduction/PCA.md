## PCA
To begin with, lets review the concept of matrix multiplication. Performing a matrix on a vector (matrix multiplication) can be interpreted as a stretched and shrinkaged behaviour. Take a 2-d matrix as an example, the shape of a unit sphere will be pressed and reshaped to another sphere after multipled by a matrix. 

Different matrixs have different effects. Specially, for a symmetric matrix the effects can be drawn and analyzed seperately, which is the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors describe the streched direction of a symmetric matrix and the coresponding eigenvalues are the shrinkaged magnitudes. Further, the symmetric property also ensure the orthogonal property among eigenvector with distinct eigenvalue, which provides a great benefit for decomposition (think of it!!)

## projection matrix ...

$A = xx^T$, $x$ is a column vector

More details, see SVD

Based on this beautiful geometry property of eigenvector
